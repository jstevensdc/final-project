        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>"What Can I See Tonight?" is a site for amateur astronomers. More specifically, What Can I See Tonight? focuses on the practical needs and questions of someone starting out - in other words, you own a telescope or set of binoculars, but you're not entirely sure of what to do with it). Topics include "Where Can I Find a Flash Light that Doesn't Blind Me (and Is tThere an App for That?)" and "Why Does High Humidity Mess up my Viewing so Much?"</p>

        <p>"What Can I See Tonight?" is produced by Jen Stevens, who started doing astronomy in a dry climate with relatively low light pollution. She now lives in a humid climate with high light pollution.</p>
