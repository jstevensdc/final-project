        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          "What Can I See Tonight?" is a site for amateur astronomers. More specifically, "What Can I See Tonight? focuses on the practical needs and questions of someone starting out - in other words, you own a telescope or set of binoculars, but you're not entirely sure what to do with it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main page shows you what viewing conditions to expect for your geographical location and date (including weather conditions, and the moon phase and rising time). In turn, the blog offers tips for viewing and the Resources page lists other useful web sites and iOS/Android apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What Can I See Tonight?" is produced by <a href="#">Jen Stevens</a>, who started doing observational astronomy in a dry climate with relatively low light pollution. She now lives in a humid climate with high light pollution.

            <!--Some kind of RSS feed/link to cool NASA images would be ideal. Could also just use a rotating selection of 10-15 saved images/captions that are randomly chosen via js.-->
