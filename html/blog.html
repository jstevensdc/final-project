      			           <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                        <p>
                              So you want to do observational astronomy. Excellent plan. So off you go to buy a telescope.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              Only there are a lot of telescopes to choose from. Reflective, refractive, which to choose? What size to get? And many of them aren't cheap. You might pay a lot for something that a) doesn't suit your needs and b) turns out to be less fun than you thought.
                        </p>
                        <p>So what do you really need to get started?</p>

                              Binoculars. Binoculars are a) generally less expensive b) easier to aim c) something that many of us already own. They're certainly no replacement for a telescope (for one thing, it's harder to aim it for someone else to look through), but they're certainly a decent way to get started. Even after getting a telescope, I still use my binoculars from time to time.

      						      <h2>Dealing with Light Pollution</h2>
      						      <p>
                            Unless you literally live in the middle of no where, you are highly likely to experience light pollution. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do aside from (short term) go somewhere else to look at the stars or (long term) advocate for less light pollution, whixh is probably a lost cause, unfortunately.
                        </p>

                            What causes light pollution? The most immediate and answer is light - street lights, house lights, car lights, and so forth. In general, a higher population of people tends to emit more night time light. However, local environmental conditions can also exacerbate that light - for instance, when the humidity get high enough, individual bits of air vapor (aerosols) literally scatter light across the sky, creating a somewhat milky effect.
