      						<h2><a href="#">Getting Started</a></h2>
                  <p>So you want to do observational astronomy. Excellent plan. So off you go to buy a telescope.</p>
                  <p>
                    Only there are a lot of telescopes to choose from. Reflective, refractive, which to choose? What size to get? And many of them aren't cheap. You might pay a lot for something that a) doesn't suit your needs and b) turns out to be less fun than you thought.
                  </p>
                  <p>So what do you really need to get started?</p>

                    Binoculars. Binoculars are a) generally less expensive b) easier to aim c) something that many of us already own.Of course, a given pair of binoculars won't necessarily be cheaper than a given telescope, but in general, you can get higher magnification for a lower cost. They're certainly no replacement for a telescope (for one thing, it's harder to aim it for someone else to look through), but they're certainly a decent way to get started. Even after getting a telescope, I still use my mine from time to time . . .

      						<h2><a href="#">Dealing with Light Pollution</a></h2>
      						<p>
                    Unless you literally live in the middle of no where, you are highly likely to experience this. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can aside from (short term) go somewhere else to look at the stars (long term) advocate for less light pollution (probably a failing effort, sadly). There are telescope filters that can reduce the glare at least somewhat, though.
                  </p>

      						<p class="hide" id="show-this-on-click">What causes light pollution?
                    The most immediate and obvious answer is light. Street lights, house lights, car lights. In general, a higher population tends to emit more light at night (perhaps most easily seen from a plane at night). However, local environmental conditions can also exacerbate that light - for instance, when the humidity get high enough, individual bits of air vapor (aerosols) literally scatter light across the sky . . .
