"What Can I See Tonight?" is a site for amateur astronomers. More specifically, WCIST focuses on the practical needs and questions of someone starting out (in other words, you own a telescope or set of binoculars, but you're not entirely sure of what to do with it). Topics include "Where Can I Find a Flash Light that Doesn't Blind Me (and is there an App for that?)" and "Why Does High Humidity Mess up my Viewing so Much?""

However, we can't promise not to flash the occasional Hubble telescope eye candy!

"What Can I See Tonight?" is produced by Jen Stevens, who started doing astronomy in a dry climate with relatively low light pollution. She now lives in a humid climate with high light pollution.




Why Does High Humidity Mess Up my Viewing So Much?

I'm from the western part of the United States, which tends to be relatively dry (especially the part that I'm from), so I'd never really dealt with the viewing consequences of high humidity before. And then some friends and I tried to use my almost new Christmas present telescope out near Warrenton, VA one balmy July evening. Warrenton may not be Orlando, FL, but it's still pretty humid.

Aside from all of the security lights around us (another topic altogether), the sky seemed not just cloudy, but really hazy.....as though we were looking at it through a fog.

Despite the light pollution, we did find a few stars to look at, but they sort of twinkled. "Those are pulsars!" one of my friends announced in delight.

Except there really aren't that many pulsars. At least not relatively speaking (current estimates are that there's roughly a million pulsars in our local galaxy, but that's only one million out of 100 <i>billion</i>).

**** note: twinkling doesn't seem to be related to high humidity (it's related to air pockets with varying degrees of hudmity, refractive indexes, and so forth, but that's not really the same. might be worth writing a bit on star twinkling)****

Later, the next day, I realized that we had been foiled by high humidity.

With all of those air born drops of water in the air between you and the stars, it really is like viewing the sky through a fog. Even worse, that fog of water vapor can scatter light, excerbating light pollution, and often casting an almost "milky" hue to the sky. High humidity can also cause water to literally condense on your telescope lens (and everywhere else).

So what can you do about it?

Not a lot really. You could take your viewing party to New Mexico or Arizona, but that's not really an option on a given evening for most of us. Or you can just try to time your viewing times for relatively low humidity days. Some times of the of the year (i.e. winter), also tend to be better. Like so many other things in astronomy, it's a trade off - warm conditions for star parties versus colder temperatures and clearer viewing. A night with a full moon and low humidity versus, say, a new moon and high humidity. Sometimes it may just be better to plan your viewing around actual conditions instead of waiting for the ideal conditions for what you'd rather see....

Getting Started

So you want to look at the skies. Excellent plan. So off you go to buy a telescope.

Only there are a lot of telescopes to choose from. Reflective, refractive, which to choose? What size to get? And many of them aren't cheap. You might pay a lot for something that a) doesn't suit your needs and b) turns out to be less fun than you thought.

So what do you really need to get started?

Binoculars.

Binoculars are a) generally less expensive b) easier to aim c) something that many of us already own.

Of course, a given pair of binoculars won't necessarily be cheaper than a given telescope, but in general, you can get higher magnification for a lower cost. They're certainly no replacement for a telescope (for one thing, it's harder to aim it for someone else to look through), but they're certainly a decent way to get started. Even after getting a telescope, I still use my mine from time to time.

The next thing you'll need are star charts. There are a number of them on paper (growing up, my favorite one was essentially a big circle with a revolving window that you could adjust according to the time and date that came with my National Geographic Our Universe book). However, there are a growing number of IOS and Android apps that will let you literally point your phone at the sky to see what (theoretically) is there. Or at least would be if you had ideal viewing conditions.

However, even with star charts, most people still use constallations as a general method for navigating and referring to specific parts of the sky. Constallations usually have stories attached, and can be a lot of fun to learn. There are several guides to them; my own favorite is H.A. Rey's The Stars: A New Way to See Them. There are also a number of IOS and Android phone apps that can help you.

Finally, I recommend some kind of red tinted flashlight (my Dad used to make them by rubber banding red cellophane over a flashlight, but you can buy special red LED flashlights now). Even in light polluted areas like mine, it can be really easy to drop lenses and filters in the dark. Unlike white "normal" light, red light won't blind you (and require another 20 minutes to adjust to seeing the night sky properly).

Given that I use my IPhone so much as a flashlight (as well as for looking stuff up at the last minute), I've been trying to find some kind of app that would make my IPhone's screens red tinted. However, not surprisingly, that's apparently really hard to do (the app would essentially have to turn all of the other apps' screens red). (Most astronomy apps do a have a red screen setting, at least) I may just have follow my Dad's lead and tape some red cellophane over my phone!

Light Pollution

Unless you literally live in the middle of no where, you are highly likely to experience this. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can aside from (short term) go somewhere else to look at the stars (long term) advocate for less light pollution (probably a failing effort, sadly). There are telescope filters that can reduce the glare at least somewhat, though.

When I lived in Boulder, Colorado, about 50 miles from Denver, you could literally see a reddish glow in the sky at night from all of the light pollution. Given that everything else in Boulder seemed so "natural" (bike trails through parks filled with trees, the Flatirions, Alfalfas...), I always found that incredibly ironic. Now I live in the Washington, DC metro area, which isn't much better. Much as I love living in a major metropolitan area, I do miss dark night skies.

What causes light pollution?

The most immediate and obvious answer is light. Street lights, house lights, car lights. In general, a higher population tends to emit more light at night (perhaps most easily seen from a plane at night). However, local environmental conditions can also exacerbate that light - for instance, when the humidity get high enough, individual bits of air vapor (aerosols) literally scatter light across the sky.

There are light pollution charts out there you can use to get an idea of where to go to escape it (they also show how it's gotten worse over time). Ultimately, for those of us who experience it, light pollution can turn even casual observational astronomy from something you do on a "regular" evening into something that requires a special trip and degree of effort, and "backyard astronomy," becomes "back country astronomy."
